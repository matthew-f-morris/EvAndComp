    1 / 2
Choosing members to make S
    Selecion in one pop operates independantly of other population
    Pop size of 25
    Players only play from other populations
Sample Size

REQUIREMENT:
    Reproduce fig 3,4,5 and contrast with 2

EXTENSION:
    How Coevolution goes wrong, can you fix it?


Psubjective(a,b) = Pobjective(f(a,Sa), f(b,Sb))
Pobjective returns the greater of the two

EQUATION 1:
    fitness(a,S) = Sum(score(a,Si)) from 1 to size of S
    score(a,b) = 1 if a > b; else 0
    a = target number, S = Sample of individuals against which a is tested

EQUATION 2:
    fitness2(a, S) = Sum(score2(a,Si)) from 1 to size of S
    score2((ax, ay), (bx, by)) = score(ax, bx), if (mod(ax - bx) > mod(ay - by)) else score(ay, by) 

EQUATION 3:
    fitness3(a,S) = Sum(score3(a,Si)) from 1 to size of S
    score3((ax, ay), (bx, by)) = score(ax, bx), if (mod(ax - bx) < mod(ay - by)) else score(ay, by)
